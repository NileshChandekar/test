*Knowledge is Power.*

**#python-pune** meetup organized *devsprint#1* this Saturday i.e on 20-02-2016. It was the first dev sprint for me as well and my first meet up as a host for the day, thanks to @cyipro and @yudocca for giving me this opportunity. 
This dev sprint was quite different than the previous ones. We have asked attendees to select the **#OpenSource** projects of their own choice to work on during the dev sprint. There were many of them who could find themselves  suitable projects and started working on, but few were completely new to **#OpenSource** contribution and so it took some time for them to start. 

At the very beginning of this dev sprint, @ciypro explained about getting started with the **#OpenSource** contributions and how one should find the projects of his/her own choice. We found most of them had the same problem in getting the projects of their interests as there are a number of projects available and for newbies, it is really very difficult to get the starting point for the **#OpenSource** contribution.  
Here are few links where I searched for the projects and helped few attendees to start with: 
- link `Fedora <http://whatcanidoforfedora.org/>`_ 
- link `OpenStack <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack/+bugs>`_
- link `Mozilla <http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/>`_

I have selected the bug from link `Congress <https://bugs.launchpad.net/congress/+bug/1415199>`_ from *OpenStack low hanging fruits* . 
Here is the link for the link `Congress <https://github.com/openstack/congress>`__ on git. Currently, the installation is available only for 
Debian. @cyipro have suggested me to update the process for 

*CentOS* and send a patch for the same. Quite easier for me to get started! :)   

During this dev sprint,  I got to know how you should get help for the projects you are working on and also the end result of working collaboratively on a single project. One of the attendees was not able to find the project, but he started working on one of the projects with few others at dev sprint and at the end of the dev sprint this group was actually able to send a small patch for that project. They all were first timers and were happy to work collaboratively for that bug. 

Although this was experimental dev sprint, not all of the attendees could find the projects and send the patches, but everyone was satisfied at the end of the day, because for many this meet up formed as a platform to learn and start with #OpenSource contributions. We had a feedback session at the end  from each of the attendees and we got many positive feedbacks for this dev sprint.  

It was a nice experience for me and got many new things added to my knowledge base. I have started preparing for more such dev sprints to happen in coming days.
