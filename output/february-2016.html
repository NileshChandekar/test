<h2># Week 5 : [Jashn]</h2>
<p>I am working on a script to automate few tasks related to my work and was facing some issues. I discussed my issues with &#64;rshbhdas initially.&#64;rshbhdas helped me to understand how the  script should work. Later I also discussed few thing about sed and awk with &#64;savitojs for my shell script. He is a System Admin for our project. We also had a bit of discussion about a Chef, Puppet, and Ansible. I got to know how he handles all the machines with just the scripts written in shell and python. &#64;ramkrsna is one of a senior member of our team. He is Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat and looks after crucial part of our project. I had a short discussion with him on my script. He was quitebusy but still, later on, he had a look at my script and asked me to write the script in a different way. &#64;ramkrsna suggested me to use Curl with Bash and API's available for that task. He also gave me some books to read for the same.</p>
<p>We also attended the first #fedora-pune meetup.Following was the agenda for first meetup:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bugyou, filing bugs on broken cloud builds.</li>
<li>Writing new tests for automated atomic/cloud images (Python3)</li>
<li>Ansible 101 workshop (Please install Anisble on your system before coming down the workshop)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was nice to meet &#64;kushaldas,&#64;siddhesh_p,&#64;yudocca and &#64;kumar_pravin at this meetup.Due to some issues it was held at &#64;ciypro's place very close to our office.In the end of this meetup venue was finalised as the same for future meetups! Fedora meetup mainly focuses on contribution to Fedora and other opensource projects.&#64;kushaldas explained how should we start with opensource contributions and about Fedora Community.&#64;yudocca explained us about his work in Pagure project and also about writing tests for automated atomic/cloud images using Python3.&#64;siddhesh_p started the disscussion with C programming and Bug triaging.Finally &#64;kumar_pravin took a short session on Ansible.He explained us about Ansible,how it works and also explained us how to write the Ansible Playbooks.Playbooks are just the scripts in Ansible in which we mention the tasks that we want to automate.It was very knowledgeble session.Second meetup was fixed in the next week.&#64;kushaldas asked us about the experience in meetup and also asked us how it should be.Most of the attendees were students,so he got awsome inputs.All were curious about this meetup as everyone of us were getting an opportunity learn and discuss on Opensource technologies.I met few new friends in this meetup.</p>
<p>We had our annual party this weekend. &#64;shrienk and our team were quite focused on our skit practice.We had a few hours of practice and discussions on the light plans, music, and overall props. Everyone at the office was busy shopping for the party.</p>
<p>Finally, we had a nice performance at [Jashn] - our annual party. This year we had a new logo that was designed by &#64;shrienk and also the skit was performed with proper music and lights for the first time. It was awesome evening. <cite>Red Carpet</cite> was the theme for the party.Our Team was rocking the party!! Had a lot of fun!
We enjoyed the [Jashn] night!</p>

<h2># Week 6 :</h2>
<p>I have started reading the ZeroConf networking book given by  &#64;ramkrsna in last week. It is basically similar concept to APIPA in Microsoft's domain of networking that we just had a bit in our networking class at college. The book is written by Stuart Cheshire the one who discovered the Zero Configuration networking and Daniel Steinberg.The book is very nicely written and now I have decided to completely read that book.Reading is really very important which I somehow always skipped in my college days and so I always lacked few basics that I realize now are very important.</p>
<p>RDO test day for Mitaka release was scheduled in this week. At RDO's website in the pending list, there were many tasks to start with.I decided to start with the simple one as many people I met, have started with the same. I am working on a definitions list for the components local to RDO. &#64;rbowen have specifically mentioned that it should be strictly local to RDO and duplications should be avoided.Since this was my first time, it was quite confusing for me to  start with the contribution.
I attended the meeting.Got to know how actually people work in OpenSource projects.I already had my setup of RDO ready on my laptop but was not getting the checkpoint tostart with so after the meeting, I requested &#64;rbowen to explain me how should I start. &#64;rbowen helped me understand the procedure for the same. He was so cool that I wasvery comfortable asking him very basic questions I had in my mind.</p>
<p>#fedora's second Pune meetup was also held at the same venue.Agenda had few topics but as the meetup started with &#64;siddhesh_p 's talk on C programming, it was focussed on the same for the entire duration of meetup.&#64;siddhesh_p explained us about C compilers and interpreters, and then topic went on to registers, memory and architectural design of computer processors.We all were really keen to know the things he was discussing, he explained how the C program runs internally that was the shocking part for me.I never heard of those terms in my college and this was the amazing discussion which concluded on the decision of going back to C programming once again for all of us.</p>
<p>I have also started pushing my changes done in shell script on git and also on gerrit for code review.</p>

<div class="section" id="python3-101">
<h2># Python3 101:</h2>
<p>Python3 101 meetup was organized by #python-pune group that is hosted by &#64;ciypro, &#64;yudocca, &#64;kushaldas and &#64;kumar_pravin. This meetup was mainly focused for the beginners in Python and for the ones who already know Python2.X but wanted to learn differences between Python2 and Python3.&#64;kushaldas started with absolute basics in Python. He covered variables, lists, dictionaries, file handling, list comprehensions and generators and most of the concepts in python initially.</p>
<p>Later we discussed few basic differences in Python3 and Python2, for eg. raw_input is now input in Python3.X, in python2 generator has a method <cite>next</cite>  in pyhthon3 generator uses <cite>next function call</cite> i.e next(x) instead of a method etc. Later on,we did some hands on with Python3, &#64;yudocca gave us some tasks like writing a <cite>ls</cite> command program in Python using OS modules, fizz buzz program, getting username and password using Python etc. It was an awesome experience for two of my friends who never did anything on Python and also for me to understand basics of it.
Next month we will be having Python DevSprint for one day in which we will be discussing on how to contribute in OpenSourcePython projects  and do some coding in Python.</p>

<h2># Week 7:</h2>
<p>I started working on some of the live issues,peer-reviewing with the help of &#64;NeetiDahiya.We had one more intern added to our interns family and yet another box of <cite>Doughnuts!</cite>. &#64;ciypro had already asked us to share whatever sessions we had, with the new joinees.&#64;shrienk has asked us to make us new joinees checklist so that it is self-explanatory enough to new joinees to do intial tasks related to our project and avoid confusions.</p>
<p>We are planning to have intern's morning and evening sessions in which everyone of us will take some topics and we will discuss on them as it will help us share our knowledge,help grow our understanding of concepts and learn new things from eachother.</p>
