    <p>Hello everyone !!</p>
<p>Getting an internship at Red Hat was like my dream come true! My parents, at first, thought that I am joking and they never expected that I would get this internship, but later on when I showed them my confirmation mail they were happy. Things changed. Mom and Dad, who used to shout at me every time were now relaxed and then they started explaining about other responsibilities at my place with a hope that I would be capable of handling them some day! ;)</p>
<p>It was December 14th, the day when I entered Red Hat, and my journey with Red Hat begins! :)</p>
<div class="section" id="week-1-kickstart-of-internship">
<h2># Week 1: Kickstart of Internship !</h2>
<p>The first week at Red Hat was very cool! On the very first day, immediately after our onboarding we started off with setting up our own machines with Fedora 23. &#64;shrienk, our Team Lead helped us with this task.  Later on, we were introduced to Devang, our Manager  and then to our Mentors. I was very excited to know about my new role and responsibilities I would have upon me. &#64;NeetiDahiya is my mentor for my term of internship.She explained us about the workflow of our project and also took a session on the internal tools we use at Red Hat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we had some sessions on Email-Etiquette, IRC - ethics and few others related to our work.</p>
<p>&#64;ciypro's sessions - we call them <cite>Gyan sessions</cite> :D made me realize how new technologies are emerging and how in the world of open source people come together to make robust software that help others and the benefits of sharing knowledge. Part of it I had known by attending one of his meetups and at Fudcon 2015, that was held in Pune after four years, in June 2015!</p>
<p>It feels really awesome to be around with geeks and learn lots of things that help you in your career. After all, I feel like I am a geek-under-progress , because I have decided one thing in mind very clearly i.e no matter whatever happens after my internship program, I will take away the knowledge that I will gain in this term of 6 months and continue the legacy of Open Source in my life by contributing to it and sharing knowledge with others !</p>
<p>It was time to get introduced to our entire team. We were introduced and &#64;shrienk explained us about our team and its workflow. Thanks to &#64;shrienk, we really liked the way of introduction to our team and ofcourse, Donuts were nice as well! :D</p>

<div class="section" id="week-2-love-the-open-source-way">
<h2># Week 2: Love the Open Source Way !</h2>
<p>So, week two started up with new lessons and some work related to our project. I have heard in few meetups at Red Hat, You get to learn new things at Red Hat.. every day! and I have already started experiencing this since my day one at Red Hat.</p>
<p>In this week,&#64;shrienk asked us to attend the Docathon event organised by one of our team at Red Hat. It was nice experience, got to know few people who are responsible for Documentation at Red Hat. I also met some of my college seniors in this event. Few sessions like Story Telling and Agile, Email communication, Open Source Culture, Minimalism etc helped me add new lessons to my knowledge base that would also help me at my work.</p>
<p>I also attended a talk on &quot;OOO&quot; that &#64;NeetiDahiya asked me to attend so that I can understand how OpenStack is deployed on production environments. Till now I only knew about DevStack and PackStack.This talk on <cite>OOO</cite>, also called as <cite>OpenStack on OpenStack</cite> or <cite>Triple O</cite>  helped me know about the actual method of deploying OpenStack. It is OSP Director that  uses some OpenStack environment to deploy on bare metal systems for production enviornments. This talk covered all the essentials of  <cite>OOO</cite> that are used to provision and manage resources associated with OpenStack, and its working, what is under cloud and over cloud  etc. Then later on we started with understanding the  Python project structure, Git Basics followed by some hands on.
Hushhh... there are so many things to learn and a long way to go.... I never ever thought of becoming a part of such an amazing organization and an Open Source community !</p>
<p>I am loving the Open Source way !!</p>

<div class="section" id="week-3-keep-calm-and-do-your-kaam">
<h2># Week 3: Keep Calm and do your Kaam !!</h2>
<p>Ok, by this time in the third week we were slowly getting acquainted with our work and responsibilities.
We had one more member in our interns family. More two interns were yet to come on board with us. I hope we all do our best in coming days and make substantial value addition to our team and our Organization.</p>
<p>We were asked to write the blog during this week and were suggested to use Pelican. I had never written a single blog before and this was intended for a reason , so that it would help us track our day to day activities, and would be helpful in many other ways like, learning Pelican, designing your own templates, a bit of Python, HTML, CSS, bootstrap, jinja2, etc. and would also help us improve our written communication skills. Initially, I started with reading Pelican docs but later I decided to do a hands on. It's really very awesome. Pelican is just a static website generator that uses Python and ReStructuredText or MarkDown to upload your content that is automatically converted to html in output directory.
In one of the session, &#64;rshbhdas explained us about Jenkins CI/CD workflow related to our project. It was totally new concept to understand just like we use Jira and Bugzilla as well.Few tools  I had just heard about them but these are the ones with which I had to get well versed with. &#64;ciypro explained us about Packaging. How to start with it and how it's  actually done in the community-based projects.</p>
<p>It was last week of the year and we are enjoying our phase of learning. I did few mistakes, and I keep on doing them but these are the ones who teach me and help me get better at my work.</p>
<p>We had a Team Dinner that week and it was really a very nice experience.</p>
<p>As usual on 31st December, right at 12:00 am,  me and my friends were at Bappa's place ( Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Temple,Pune ) to get his blessings for the coming year - 2o16 !  Great start to the New Year !!! Cheers !! : )</p>

<div class="section" id="week-4-tick-tick-tick-time-is-running">
<h2># Week 4 : Tick..tick...Tick....Time is running...!!</h2>
<p>Time flies when you are working.... seems to be true!  :D
We had completed our 1st month at Red Hat and there are lots of things we need to learn. New Year and new resolutions .... I think it is time to get serious about career, so I had set my personal Goals  and I am trying my best to achieve them.
Sometimes I am finding really very difficult to work on some tasks but my mentors are really very understanding. They are helping  me at my every blocker I am facing and so it motivates me to work as well.
After all, I am working with all the geeks and I am willing to be like them some day !!
I have started working on RDO: Deployed it on my Laptop and preparing for Mitaka test day !! :) I will also start contributing to RDO and then later on start understanding other upstream projects as well.</p>
<p>Another round of donuts for our new member in Interns family was ready !!! &#64;shrienk is his mentor. I have also participated in &#64;shrienk's skit that we will be performing on our Annual Party this weekend.
We will be attending Fedora meetup happening this week and also Python-Pune meet up in next week.</p>
<p>Thanks to &#64;NeetiDahiya, my mentor and all other mentors,&#64;shrienk and one of my college  seniors &#64;SuprithG, who is also working in the same team as I do !</p>
<p>This is my first blog and I have enjoyed every bit of writing it . Hope so I would improve on it in my upcoming posts.... :D</p>
<p>May the force be with all of us !!</p>
